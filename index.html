		<h1>What is Rocket League?</h1>
		<p>
		Rocket League is an extremely engaging online multiplayer game in which users play arena soccer with customizable rocket-powered battle cars. From its sporty and strategic gameplay to its realistic physics engine and high-octane demolitions, Rocket League’s ability to pair easy to understand gameplay with mechanics that take years to master has led it to be a world wide phenomenon. Since Psyonix Studios initially released Rocket League in July of 2015, the game has officially surpassed 75 million unique players as of July 7, 2020 <a class="source-sup" href="#source1">[1]</a>, and over 1 million concurrent players in September of that same year.<a class="source-sup" href="#source2">[2]</a>
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		But where did Rocket League come from? What is it about its unique gameplay that is so engaging? What were the marketing challenges when developing a game about “car soccer”? How does a game built on a 15 year old engine stay relevant in 2021 and beyond? What were the business trade-offs behind it going free-to-play? How did Epic’s acquisition of Psyonix affect the game and the industry? Why do some in-game cosmetic items sell for over $10,000 USD? Why... “Rocket League”? What led up to <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KNG7r1n6Jk8?t=41">this</a> legendary broadcaster call? What is next on the horizon?
		These questions and so many more fascinating aspects of the game will be discussed in this blog on a weekly basis. Strap in!

		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>
		My name is Matt Holsten, and I’m an Engineering student at Tufts University studying Computer Science; importantly, I <i>love</i> Rocket League. I have been playing Rocket League constantly since 2016. For every weekend and summer break while in highschool, and every available moment since, Rocket League has been my passion, my outlet for expression, my way to wind down, and my way to pick myself up. There are many curveballs in life, but in the midst of that, Rocket League has been steady (...well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/a23lm9/how_we_added_real_curveballs_to_rocket_league/">mostly</a>). While just a video game on the surface, Rocket League has been a guiding and rewarding force of good in my life; it has taught me that with patience, determination, and teamwork, goals that may seem ludicrous at one point or another can be achieved. As of writing, I am ranked Grand Champion 3 and am in the top 0.1% of active players.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3">[1]</a> I have poured roughly 2,500 hours into Rocket League; considering I am currently 20 years old, that amounts to  ~1.4% of my life.<a class="source-sup" href="#source4">[2]</a> Assuming the average person will spend one third of their life asleep <a class="source-sup" href="#source5">[3]</a>, I have spent ~2.1% of my waking hours playing Rocket League; for every 50 seconds I have spent awake, one of those seconds have been on Rocket League. This doesn’t even include the amount of time I’ve spent reading or watching casual and informative Rocket League content, which is surely in the hundreds of hours. So, given my passion for Rocket League and the amount of time I have been around it, I can assure that what I write about here weekly will be informative and relevant content. We will dive into the world of Rocket League on an analytical and personal level, and I am extremely excited for it!

		<h1>An Unreal Beginning</h1>
		<p>
			Rocket League was released by Psyonix Studios in July of 2015 and quickly became a server-breaking success. However, like many endeavors, the true personality and character of Rocket League were behind the scenes, nearly a decade in the making.
			<br>
			<br>

			The story of the development of Rocket League is centered around Dave Hagewood, the creator of Psyonix Studios. When Dave was only 6 years old he loved playing on his dad’s TI-99 4/A computer.<a class="source-sup" href="#source6">[1]</a> Players in the games were all composed of a series of ASCII characters,<a class="source-sup" href="#source7">[2]</a> and movement was shown through a series of slightly altered ASCII files. Dave quickly discovered that if he found those character files in the computer, he could directly edit the players to look like whatever he wanted. Although a simple concept, this idea of being able to use tools and building blocks other people have made to create something special and unique for himself is at the core of Rocket League’s genesis, as we will continue to see.
			<br> <br>
			Dave dropped out of college to pursue the creation of a website hosting business in the late 90s. Alongside this, Dave continued to have a passion for modding and video game design. Around this time, the internet was growing at an extremely fast pace,<a class="source-sup" href="#source8">[3]</a> and Dave was able to use that momentum and resulting profit to hire team-members to begin a game studio that would would later be known as Psyonix. At the time, Psyonix was only a few people. Many studios have dozens, if not hundreds of developers working full time to create all aspects of any given game. For example, development studio Activision has stated that they have roughly 500 developers working full time on their Call of Duty game series,<a class="source-sup" href="#source9">[4]</a> which has made them nearly 30 Billion dollars since 2003.<a class="source-sup" href="#source10">[5]</a> Also, there are many aspects of development for any given video game; everything from graphic design and art, to server/backend development and maintenance. However, for many games, the most time intensive and costly task is developing the game engine, or the core building blocks with which the rest of the game is made (more on game engines in a later blog post). So, for a small studio of only a handful of people, the prospect of creating a brand new game was quite daunting. However, from Dave’s roots of modifying or “modding” games on his dad’s computer -- and similar modding backgrounds amongst other studio members -- came another idea: instead of creating a new game from the ground up, create modifications or “mods” for a pre-existing game, and advertise those to game companies as dedicated game modes.
			<br><br>
			So, Dave and the team set off to complete this task. Their target: Unreal Tournament,<a class="source-sup" href="#source11">[6]</a> created by Epic Games. The Unreal Tournament (“UT”) series were arena-style first person player-vs-player games built on Epic’s UnrealScript/Unreal Engine. While common today, 3rd party game mods were not as prolific at the time, so UT made a name for itself by having its game be made from the ground up with the intention of promoting 3rd party mods. This model of allowing the users to support the studio’s game after launch turned out to be highly successful for Epic, as many people -- including Dave and Psyonix studios -- went on to make brilliant mods for UT. In an interview,<a class="source-sup" href="#source12">[7]</a> Dave recalls that Epic was very interested in having vehicles in their games, much like the Halo games did at the time. Given this knowledge and having an excited team of modders behind him, Dave set out to do just that -- create a mod to add vehicles to UT. After working hard the following year developing this mod (called… “Vehicle Mod”), they presented it to Epic and it was an instant hit. Epic was so impressed that they offered for Dave and his team to work directly out of the offices at Epic to create an official game mode for the next game in their UT series, Unreal Tournament 2004.<a class="source-sup" href="#source13">[8]</a> The Psyonix team worked diligently that year on producing this mode, “Onslaught”.<a class="source-sup" href="#source14">[9]</a> Along the way, they tried out many game mechanics and features; one of the more whimsical game mechanics they included was the ability to do “tricks” with the vehicles. Dave said, “that's one of the things I think I really enjoyed about UT, there weren't any rules -- you could do almost anything.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source12">[7]</a> Working closely with their level designer, Ben Beckwith, the team was able to integrate many platforms and jumps that encouraged this mechanic throughout their maps. When UT 2004 launched, Onslaught was its defining game-mode and was very successful. And although players ultimately did not fall in love with the “tricks” aspect of the game mode, the dev team loved it, and held onto the concept for later. 
			<br><br>
			UT 2004 was built primarily on what is now known as Unreal Engine 2.5.<a class="source-sup" href="#source15">[10]</a> So, due to working on UT 2004, Dave and the team became extremely familiar with the inner workings of UT’s game engine. Importantly, Psyonix was able to get the inside scoop on many of Epic’s projects, including the behind-the-scenes production of Epic’s Unreal Engine 3<a class="source-sup" href="#source16">[11]</a> -- the engine Rocket League would eventually be created on...
			
			But before discussing that, we will see how Dave and Psyonix were able to work with Epic to create various game titles with Unreal Engine 3, including Rocket League’s predecessor: <i>deep breath...</i><br><br> "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars".<a class="source-sup" href="#source17">[12]</a>
