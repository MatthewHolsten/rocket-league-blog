		<h1>What is Rocket League?</h1>
		<p>
		Rocket League is an extremely engaging online multiplayer game in which users play arena soccer with customizable rocket-powered battle cars. From its sporty and strategic gameplay to its realistic physics engine and high-octane demolitions, Rocket League’s ability to pair easy to understand gameplay with mechanics that take years to master has led it to be a world wide phenomenon. Since Psyonix Studios initially released Rocket League in July of 2015, the game has officially surpassed 75 million unique players as of July 7, 2020 <a class="source-sup" href="#source1">[1]</a>, and over 1 million concurrent players in September of that same year.<a class="source-sup" href="#source2">[2]</a>

		But where did Rocket League come from? What is it about its unique gameplay that is so engaging? What were the marketing challenges when developing a game about “car soccer”? How does a game built on a 15 year old engine stay relevant in 2021 and beyond? What were the business trade-offs behind it going free-to-play? How did Epic’s acquisition of Psyonix affect the game and the industry? Why do some in-game cosmetic items sell for over $10,000 USD? Why... “Rocket League”? What led up to <a href="https://youtu.be/KNG7r1n6Jk8?t=41">this</a> legendary broadcaster call? What is next on the horizon?
		These questions and so many more fascinating aspects of the game will be discussed in this blog on a weekly basis. Strap in!

		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>
		My name is Matt Holsten, and I’m an Engineering student at Tufts University studying Computer Science; importantly, I <i>love</i> Rocket League. I have been playing Rocket League constantly since 2016. For every weekend and summer break while in highschool, and every available moment since, Rocket League has been my passion, my outlet for expression, my way to wind down, and my way to pick myself up. There are many curveballs in life, but in the midst of that, Rocket League has been steady (...well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/a23lm9/how_we_added_real_curveballs_to_rocket_league/">mostly</a>). While just a video game on the surface, Rocket League has been a guiding and rewarding force of good in my life; it has taught me that with patience, determination, and teamwork, goals that may seem ludicrous at one point or another can be achieved. As of writing, I am ranked Grand Champion 3 and am in the top 0.1% of active players.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3">[3]</a> I have poured roughly 2,500 hours into Rocket League; considering I am currently 20 years old, that amounts to roughly ~1.4% of my life.<a class="source-sup" href="#source4">[4]</a> Assuming the average person will spend one third of their life asleep <a class="source-sup" href="#source5">[5]</a>, I have spent ~2.1% of my waking hours playing Rocket League; for every 50 seconds I have spent awake, one of those seconds have been on Rocket League. This doesn’t even include the amount of time I’ve spent reading or watching casual and informative Rocket League content, which is surely in the hundreds of hours. So, given my passion for Rocket League and the amount of time I have been around it, I can assure that what I write about here weekly will be informative and relevant content. We will look at Rocket League on an analytical and personal level, and I am extremely excited for it.
