		<h1>What is Rocket League?</h1>
		<p>
		Rocket League is an extremely engaging online multiplayer game in which users play arena soccer with customizable rocket-powered battle cars. From its sporty and strategic gameplay to its realistic physics engine and high-octane demolitions, Rocket League’s ability to pair easy to understand gameplay with mechanics that take years to master has led it to be a world wide phenomenon. Since Psyonix Studios initially released Rocket League in July of 2015, the game has officially surpassed 75 million unique players as of July 7, 2020 <a class="source-sup" href="#source1">[1]</a>, and over 1 million concurrent players in September of that same year.<a class="source-sup" href="#source2">[2]</a>
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		But where did Rocket League come from? What is it about its unique gameplay that is so engaging? What were the marketing challenges when developing a game about “car soccer”? How does a game built on a 15 year old engine stay relevant in 2021 and beyond? What were the business trade-offs behind it going free-to-play? How did Epic’s acquisition of Psyonix affect the game and the industry? Why do some in-game cosmetic items sell for over $10,000 USD? Why... “Rocket League”? What led up to <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KNG7r1n6Jk8?t=41">this</a> legendary broadcaster call? What is next on the horizon?
		These questions and so many more fascinating aspects of the game will be discussed in this blog on a weekly basis. Strap in!

		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>
		My name is Matt Holsten, and I’m an Engineering student at Tufts University studying Computer Science; importantly, I <i>love</i> Rocket League. I have been playing Rocket League constantly since 2016. For every weekend and summer break while in highschool, and every available moment since, Rocket League has been my passion, my outlet for expression, my way to wind down, and my way to pick myself up. There are many curveballs in life, but in the midst of that, Rocket League has been steady (...well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/a23lm9/how_we_added_real_curveballs_to_rocket_league/" target="_blank" >mostly</a>). While just a video game on the surface, Rocket League has been a guiding and rewarding force of good in my life; it has taught me that with patience, determination, and teamwork, goals that may seem ludicrous at one point or another can be achieved. As of writing, I am ranked Grand Champion 3 and am in the top 0.1% of active players.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3">[1]</a> I have poured roughly 2,500 hours into Rocket League; considering I am currently 20 years old, that amounts to  ~1.4% of my life.<a class="source-sup" href="#source4">[2]</a> Assuming the average person will spend one third of their life asleep <a class="source-sup" href="#source5">[3]</a>, I have spent ~2.1% of my waking hours playing Rocket League; for every 50 seconds I have spent awake, one of those seconds have been on Rocket League. This doesn’t even include the amount of time I’ve spent reading or watching casual and informative Rocket League content, which is surely in the hundreds of hours. So, given my passion for Rocket League and the amount of time I have been around it, I can assure that what I write about here weekly will be informative and relevant content. We will dive into the world of Rocket League on an analytical and personal level, and I am extremely excited for it!

		<h1>An Unreal Beginning</h1>
		<p>
			Rocket League was released by Psyonix Studios in July of 2015 and quickly became a server-breaking success. However, like many endeavors, the true personality and character of Rocket League were behind the scenes, nearly a decade in the making.
			<br>
			<br>

			The story of the development of Rocket League is centered around Dave Hagewood, the creator of Psyonix Studios. When Dave was only 6 years old he loved playing on his dad’s TI-99 4/A computer.<a class="source-sup" href="#source6">[1]</a> Players in the games were all composed of a series of ASCII characters,<a class="source-sup" href="#source7">[2]</a> and movement was shown through a series of slightly altered ASCII files. Dave quickly discovered that if he found those character files in the computer, he could directly edit the players to look like whatever he wanted. Although a simple concept, this idea of being able to use tools and building blocks other people have made to create something special and unique for himself is at the core of Rocket League’s genesis, as we will continue to see.
			<br> <br>
			Dave dropped out of college to pursue the creation of a website hosting business in the late 90s. Alongside this, Dave continued to have a passion for modding and video game design. Around this time, the internet was growing at an extremely fast pace,<a class="source-sup" href="#source8">[3]</a> and Dave was able to use that momentum and resulting profit to hire team-members to begin a game studio that would later be known as Psyonix. At the time, Psyonix was only a few people. Many studios have dozens, if not hundreds of developers working full time to create all aspects of any given game. For example, development studio Activision has stated that they have roughly 500 developers working full time on their Call of Duty game series,<a class="source-sup" href="#source9">[4]</a> which has made them nearly 30 Billion dollars since 2003.<a class="source-sup" href="#source10">[5]</a> Also, there are many aspects of development for any given video game; everything from graphic design and art, to server/backend development and maintenance. However, for many games, the most time intensive and costly task is developing the game engine, or the core building blocks with which the rest of the game is made (more on game engines in a later blog post). So, for a small studio of only a handful of people, the prospect of creating a brand new game was quite daunting. However, from Dave’s roots of modifying or “modding” games on his dad’s computer -- and similar modding backgrounds amongst other studio members -- came another idea: instead of creating a new game from the ground up, create modifications or “mods” for a pre-existing game, and advertise those to game companies as dedicated game modes.
			<br><br>
			So, Dave and the team set off to complete this task. Their target: Unreal Tournament,<a class="source-sup" href="#source11">[6]</a> created by Epic Games. The Unreal Tournament (“UT”) series were arena-style first person player-vs-player games built on Epic’s UnrealScript/Unreal Engine. While common today, 3rd party game mods were not as prolific at the time, so UT made a name for itself by having its game be made from the ground up with the intention of promoting 3rd party mods. This model of allowing the users to support the studio’s game after launch turned out to be highly successful for Epic, as many people -- including Dave and Psyonix studios -- went on to make brilliant mods for UT. In an interview,<a class="source-sup" href="#source12">[7]</a> Dave recalls that Epic was very interested in having vehicles in their games, much like the Halo games did at the time. Given this knowledge and having an excited team of modders behind him, Dave set out to do just that -- create a mod to add vehicles to UT. After working hard the following year developing this mod (called… “Vehicle Mod”), they presented it to Epic and it was an instant hit. Epic was so impressed that they offered for Dave and his team to work directly out of the offices at Epic to create an official game mode for the next game in their UT series, Unreal Tournament 2004.<a class="source-sup" href="#source13">[8]</a> The Psyonix team worked diligently that year on producing this mode, “Onslaught”.<a class="source-sup" href="#source14">[9]</a> Along the way, they tried out many game mechanics and features; one of the more whimsical game mechanics they included was the ability to do “tricks” with the vehicles. Dave said, “that's one of the things I think I really enjoyed about UT, there weren't any rules -- you could do almost anything.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source12">[7]</a> Working closely with their level designer, Ben Beckwith, the team was able to integrate many platforms and jumps that encouraged this mechanic throughout their maps. When UT 2004 launched, Onslaught was its defining game-mode and was very successful. And although players ultimately did not fall in love with the “tricks” aspect of the game mode, the dev team loved it, and held onto the concept for later. 
			<br><br>
			UT 2004 was built primarily on what is now known as Unreal Engine 2.5.<a class="source-sup" href="#source15">[10]</a> So, due to working on UT 2004, Dave and the team became extremely familiar with the inner workings of UT’s game engine. Importantly, Psyonix was able to get the inside scoop on many of Epic’s projects, including the behind-the-scenes production of Epic’s Unreal Engine 3<a class="source-sup" href="#source16">[11]</a> -- the engine Rocket League would eventually be created on...
			
			But before discussing that, we will see how Dave and Psyonix were able to work with Epic to create various game titles with Unreal Engine 3, including Rocket League’s predecessor: <i>deep breath...</i><br><br> "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars".<a class="source-sup" href="#source17">[12]</a>

		<h1>Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars</h1>
		<p>
			Last week, we discussed how in the early 2000s, Dave Hagewood’s small team of programmers, Psyonix Studios (“Psyonix”), earned the respect of Epic Games (“Epic”) when Psyonix created “Onslaught”, a vehicle-based game mode for Epic’s Unreal Tournament 2004 (“UT 2004”) using Epic’s proprietary game engine, Unreal Engine (v2.5).<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_1">[1]</a>
			<br><br>
			We left off with many questions, namely, where will Psyonix’s familiarity and proficiency with Unreal Engine lead them going forward, and how does it all eventually lead to the Rocket League game we know and love today? As has already been shown, the answers to these questions are fascinating… but not at all straightforward.
			<br><br>
			From working so closely with Epic on UT 2004, Dave had the leg up when he branched out with his Psyonix Studios team. In an interview,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_2">[2]</a> Dave stated, “I got that inside scoop on what Epic was doing and learned all about how the real game companies do it.” One of these “inside scoops” was that Epic’s Unreal Engine 3 (“UE3”)<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_3">[3]</a> would soon be released, and because of Psyonix’s familiarity with UE3, Epic would be looking to give them contract work. As will be discussed in a future blog post, Unreal Engine 3 would go on to be a massively popular game engine for hundreds of popular titles. <a class="source-sup" href="#source3_4">[4]</a> At the forefront of this revolution was Dave and his team, ready to jump on any opportunities they were presented with where they could use their Unreal Engine skills.
			<br><br>
			In anticipation of UE3’s launch, Dave tried to expand his team but ran into roadblocks. Ben Beckwith was already hired on to be the Lead Level Designer for Onslaught in UT 2004, but finding other talent who were willing to take an opportunity-cost risk to work for a startup like Psyonix was difficult; Dave stated, “I couldn’t hire anyone from the industry… they were like ‘Who is Psyonix?...I am going to go work for a really cool company.’” So, Dave created a “competitive internship” in October 2006. To entice people to work for him, he advertised that he knew all about Unreal Engine 3, and that “it is going to be big." He proclaimed, “I am big friends with Epic Games, and they’re giving me contract work.” Interestingly, although Epic created the engine and have many skilled developers who are knowledgeable about UE3, they didn’t outsource their game development expertise to other studios or publishers. Psyonix, however, saw this gap in the market and looked to essentially be a UE3 contracting company, where they would help other development teams work with the engine to create new games. 
			<br><br>
			So, Psyonix was in a really unique position, and that sentiment resonated with a few of the interns who would later become key figures in Rocket League’s development; Jared Cone would go on to be Rocket League’s Lead Gameplay Engineer, and Corey Davis would become Rocket League’s Design Director.
			<br><br>
			Approaching the release of UE3, Dave and the team had established two foundational rules for Psyonix’s future. Dave stated, “we’re always going to keep the company stable, we always need work coming in -- that’s kind of our base. But, we always need somebody working on original content. You go one way or another and it can be pretty dangerous.” Essentially, Dave was establishing that going “all-in” on the development of one game is extremely risky for a studio. Emmy Jonassen,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_5">[5]</a> the VP of Acquisition at Hubspot and a game marketing expert with over a decade of experience in the space said in 2013 that “95% of indie-games are not profitable. 80% of them operate at a loss.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_6">[6]</a> Back in 2007, This figure was likely even more dire for independent game studios, and Dave knew that truth. So, Dave’s thought was that taking a risk like that is likely to fail, and that instead they would need to rely on contract work as a steady income source. However, conversely, Dave and his team were also modders at heart, with creativity and creation in their blood; they  all wanted to develop something that was truly their own vision -- their “dream game”. So, instead of going all in on one game or going all in on contract work, the team decided they would amortize their game development risk over a long time while accumulating funds with contract work, and sooner or later, they would catch their big break. Dave reiterated that the fall of many studios was that they failed to maintain this balance; the studio would end up relocating their employees to either the contract or in-studio development teams when one or the other was more demanding. He insisted that if this happened, whichever side got less attention would end up dissolving. So, with these rules established, they began both their contract work, and their own game. Their contract work was clearly in front of them, but what would be their game?
			<br><br>
			That game would be a car acrobatics game based on the mechanisms developed in Onslaught in UT 2004. The initial idea for the game was roughly based on Dave and Ben Beckwith’s love of trick games such as the Tony Hawk skate games.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_7">[7]</a> Their game would include cars that could fly off of ramps and perform stunts, but as far as the actual goals of the game, much was up in the air.  “We didn’t know what it was, we just knew it involved cars that can jump and trick around,” said Dave. They tried many things, including timed obstacle courses, having cars that could shoot in a battle game (more reminiscent of Onslaught), Capture the Flag, Cops and Robbers, and many more. They eventually landed on developing a battle mode where, in American Gladiators or Smash-Bros style, players would try to push other cars off of a floating platform in the sky. This mode was initially called “Crash Course”, however later, “because the game was so crazy,” they changed it to be known as “Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars” (“SARPBC”). The game was fun and was eventually offered a deal to be released on Xbox. SARPBC wasn’t without its issues, though. For example, the inherent difficulty of being able to hit other people off of the map while not falling off yourself actually detracted from the chaotic-fun energy the team envisioned. 
			<br><br>
			One day, Adam Beckwith, Ben’s brother, suggested adding a ball into the game. Adam and Ben had loved Deathball, a handball-like game with fun fast paced gameplay. “We loved the physics, sport, but individual-player aspect of the sport,” Ben said. Dave agreed to develop the mode, stating “we can try it... it would be a cool side mode." Well, this “side mode” was so much fun that despite having already negotiated a deal with Xbox to release SARPBC, they wanted to change course and develop this new game instead. “I don’t think for the next two weeks we got any work done because we were just playing this game,” Dave said. The difficulty was that Xbox was very strict about its platform, to the point where you couldn’t have a game on Xbox without a publisher, and as Dave said about SARPBC, “publishers were [already] looking at our game saying ‘I don’t get it at all’, and we weren’t making it any better by saying ‘okay now it is soccer with cars.’” Given this restrictiveness and difficulty marketing the concept of “car-soccer”, Psyonix decided to try to release the game on Playstation, which at the time was much more flexible with its creators and the requirements for publishing. So this was it, the genesis of the new SARPBC, a car-soccer game on Playstation.
			<br><br>
			In 2003, SARPBC was released on the PS3. As can be seen in the game’s original trailer,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_8">[8]</a> the game closely resembled the Rocket League we know today. However due to many factors, such as a poor name for marketing purposes and a variety of quirks and unpolished attributes, the game was not an overwhelming success. Corey Davis said in an interview<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_9">[9]</a> that “a lot of things that sabotaged [SARBPC] were techincal inefficiencies.” For example, Corey stated that the development team had always played the game on PCs, with “no input latency at 60 frames-per-second on a LAN connection” and that it was “[like a] different [game],” to play on PS3 over the internet. And while SARPBC would go on to eventually turn a profit two years after its release, it was a disappointment to the developers at Psyonix. Corey would go on to say “I think when you’re a veteran it hits you a little harder when something you make… isn’t a huge success. And at the time it was the second thing we had done, so it felt like ‘of course we will just move on to other projects.’”
			<br><br>
			Dave discussed how it is difficult during the final stages of a game’s development not to be all hands on deck -- the contracting aspect of the company was put on the backburner as they were nearing the release of SARPBC. He clearly bent his own rule about maintaining distance between the two different aspects of the company, and that this “pushed the company to the brink.” Dave had poured so much company time and resources into SARPBC, and since it wasn’t financially successful, they had to quickly revert back to doing more contract work. Dave recalls that “[Psyonix] had to take some projects quickly afterwards that were maybe not the most ideal terms and were really tough on us.” Further solidifying the difficulty Dave was alluding to previously about going all-in on one game’s development. If I were to guess, Dave’s rules about the duality of the studio weren’t even firm up to this point in his career as he likes to recount; I imagine instead that it was this moment after SARPBC’s failure that really drove home the risk involved to Dave with investing everything into one game’s development.
			<br><br>
			On top of the financial difficulty, an especially hard pill to swallow for the developers was that they personally loved playing SARPBC so much and they believed strongly that the game was capable of being successful if people really got into it. Dave said he thought at the time, “we need a bigger studio, we need more expertise at what we are doing… we are going to come back to [SARPBC],” and that “we always knew we were coming back to it at some point.” 
			<br><br>
			So, to strengthen their studio and stay afloat as a company, they took on more contract work. Psyonix went on to make a name for themselves by being very good at online multiplayer on UE3. For example, they worked on “Mass Effect 3”<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_10">[10]</a> as UE3 consultants, and then studios of other games, such as “Bulletstorm”,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_11">[11]</a> contracted Psyonix to develop their entire multiplayer mode. Eventually the publishing company Square Enix<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_12">[12]</a> contracted Psyonix to develop their entire game “Nosgoth”.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_13">[13]</a> Dave said “[Nosgoth] was a big deal for the studio. It allowed us to expand a lot, build our art team in particular and kind of become a really full-featured studio.” It was around this time that Psyonix decided to take another look at SARPBC.
			<br><br>
			Corey recalls, “you want to give contract work your all, especially just to keep the company going, but you always have these outlets for like ‘this is how we would do it if we were in charge.’” And now, being a full-featured studio capable of being in-charge, it was time to revisit SARPBC and create their dream game: Rocket League.

				<h1>Rocket League: AAA... Car-Soccer?</h1>
		<p>
			Last week, we discussed how Rocket League’s “car-soccer” predecessor, “Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars” (“SARPBC”) was created. Despite SARPBC capturing the intense interest of the development team at Psyonix Studios (“Psyonix”), SARPBC was not a massive hit with the general public. From poor optimization for consoles to unpolished gameplay mechanics to a -- quite frankly -- awful name for marketing purposes, the game clearly reflected Psyonix’s small team size and general lack of experience when SARPBC was released in 2008. However, in the years following its release, Psyonix would evolve into much more than the near-indie-game development team they were when they embarked on the creation of SARPBC. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			As discussed last week, after finishing SARPBC, Psyonix took on contract work for various AAA games where they could utilize their already-existing Unreal Engine 3 expertise. A couple of these games included “Mass Effect 3”<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_1">[1]</a> and “Nosgoth,”<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_2">[2]</a> -- extremely popular and successful games. But that success not only meant the ability to hire more employees and continue to expand, the games were litmus tests indicating how far the team had come since the years prior when they worked on SARPBC. Dave Hagewood, Psyonix founder and CEO, spoke in an interview<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_3">[3]</a> about this: “all of the games that we were working on on the contract-work side are Unreal Engine 3, so they’re AAA, so we built a AAA team. We were used to not working on indie games anymore, we were making the best games in the business.” Essentially stating that through their money-making efforts of doing contract work, they nearly accidentally curated an expert team of AAA developers who were capable of creating some of the best games in the industry. Dave continues, saying he and the studio who loved SARPBC then had a thought: “let’s take our indie game, and let’s put the best-games-in-the-business side of things in it.” Here, Dave is stating that SARPBC, the studio’s first original title, was merely an indie game, and that with the experience they accrued, Psyonix could recreate it and make it really work this time.

			But if they were going to do it, they were going to do it. Dave recalls they were going to take all of the best features that they had worked obsessively on in other games and put them into SARPBC’s successor. Dave said, “we need the polish, we need the user interface, we need the matchmaking features that are up there with Halo and Call of Duty.” If they were going to revisit SARPBC -- which they know failed previously -- there would need to be no stone unturned. “There was this paranoia… if we didn’t … put everything we possibly could into this game, it might have the same reaction that it did the first time. And I think that’s why we just did the hell out of it.” Funnily, Dave also recalls that after developing Rocket League with all of these AAA-title features, “people were surprised. They were like ‘this is a weird game yet it has this polish that we haven’t seen on a game so zany.’” Corey Davis, SARPBC and Rocket League’s Design Director also said that “it was kind of embarrassing when you talk to other friends in the industry and they ask ‘what are you guys working on’ and I’m like ‘cars with soccer,’ and they would be like [sarcastically], ‘oh thats… cool….’”<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_3">[3]</a> Corey also said that “if you can expose it to people they seem to really like it but if you cant then it’s kind of a hard sell: ‘cars with soccer’ that sounds kind of stupid”.

			And that was very true for multiple reasons. I can personally admit that when I had first heard of Rocket League, I thought the concept was a bit awkward and something I would have no interest in. I happened to stumble upon a youtuber I liked at the time playing the game and I thought, “well if they are playing the game, I will at least take a look.” I ended up watching gameplay of it and found it intriguing. I eventually downloaded it to try it for myself, and, well, here I am five years later dedicating hours out of every week researching and writing solely about the game.

			Additionally, even two years after the game’s release, there was a steady player base on SARPBC. This reaffirmed to the team that SARPBC and Rocket League’s biggest challenge was exposing people to the game who would have discounted it otherwise for being too “zany” as I had done. So, the team determined that they would jump on any opportunity for free promotion of the game, including free-to-play weekends or similar events. And in fact, Psyonix did “[do] the hell out of it” and create their “dream-game,” Rocket League with all of the bells and whistles they imagined. But simply doing free promotion turned out to be a far more complex decision and turning point for Psyonix as we will see next week when we discuss Rocket League’s release for free on Playstation Plus.
