		<h1>What is Rocket League?</h1>
		<p>
		Rocket League is an extremely engaging online multiplayer game in which users play arena soccer with customizable rocket-powered battle cars. From its sporty and strategic gameplay to its realistic physics engine and high-octane demolitions, Rocket League’s ability to pair easy to understand gameplay with mechanics that take years to master has led it to be a world wide phenomenon. Since Psyonix Studios initially released Rocket League in July of 2015, the game has officially surpassed 75 million unique players as of July 7, 2020 <a class="source-sup" href="#source1">[1]</a>, and over 1 million concurrent players in September of that same year.<a class="source-sup" href="#source2">[2]</a>
		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		But where did Rocket League come from? What is it about its unique gameplay that is so engaging? What were the marketing challenges when developing a game about “car soccer”? How does a game built on a 15 year old engine stay relevant in 2021 and beyond? What were the business trade-offs behind it going free-to-play? How did Epic’s acquisition of Psyonix affect the game and the industry? Why do some in-game cosmetic items sell for over $10,000 USD? Why... “Rocket League”? What led up to <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KNG7r1n6Jk8?t=41">this</a> legendary broadcaster call? What is next on the horizon?
		These questions and so many more fascinating aspects of the game will be discussed in this blog on a weekly basis. Strap in!

		<h1>Who am I?</h1>
		<p>
		My name is Matt Holsten, and I’m an Engineering student at Tufts University studying Computer Science; importantly, I <i>love</i> Rocket League. I have been playing Rocket League constantly since 2016. For every weekend and summer break while in highschool, and every available moment since, Rocket League has been my passion, my outlet for expression, my way to wind down, and my way to pick myself up. There are many curveballs in life, but in the midst of that, Rocket League has been steady (...well, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RocketLeague/comments/a23lm9/how_we_added_real_curveballs_to_rocket_league/" target="_blank" >mostly</a>). While just a video game on the surface, Rocket League has been a guiding and rewarding force of good in my life; it has taught me that with patience, determination, and teamwork, goals that may seem ludicrous at one point or another can be achieved. As of writing, I am ranked Grand Champion 3 and am in the top 0.1% of active players.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3">[1]</a> I have poured roughly 2,500 hours into Rocket League; considering I am currently 20 years old, that amounts to  ~1.4% of my life.<a class="source-sup" href="#source4">[2]</a> Assuming the average person will spend one third of their life asleep <a class="source-sup" href="#source5">[3]</a>, I have spent ~2.1% of my waking hours playing Rocket League; for every 50 seconds I have spent awake, one of those seconds have been on Rocket League. This doesn’t even include the amount of time I’ve spent reading or watching casual and informative Rocket League content, which is surely in the hundreds of hours. So, given my passion for Rocket League and the amount of time I have been around it, I can assure that what I write about here weekly will be informative and relevant content. We will dive into the world of Rocket League on an analytical and personal level, and I am extremely excited for it!

		<h1>An Unreal Beginning</h1>
		<p>
			Rocket League was released by Psyonix Studios in July of 2015 and quickly became a server-breaking success. However, like many endeavors, the true personality and character of Rocket League were behind the scenes, nearly a decade in the making.
			<br>
			<br>

			The story of the development of Rocket League is centered around Dave Hagewood, the creator of Psyonix Studios. When Dave was only 6 years old he loved playing on his dad’s TI-99 4/A computer.<a class="source-sup" href="#source6">[1]</a> Players in the games were all composed of a series of ASCII characters,<a class="source-sup" href="#source7">[2]</a> and movement was shown through a series of slightly altered ASCII files. Dave quickly discovered that if he found those character files in the computer, he could directly edit the players to look like whatever he wanted. Although a simple concept, this idea of being able to use tools and building blocks other people have made to create something special and unique for himself is at the core of Rocket League’s genesis, as we will continue to see.
			<br> <br>
			Dave dropped out of college to pursue the creation of a website hosting business in the late 90s. Alongside this, Dave continued to have a passion for modding and video game design. Around this time, the internet was growing at an extremely fast pace,<a class="source-sup" href="#source8">[3]</a> and Dave was able to use that momentum and resulting profit to hire team-members to begin a game studio that would later be known as Psyonix. At the time, Psyonix was only a few people. Many studios have dozens, if not hundreds of developers working full time to create all aspects of any given game. For example, development studio Activision has stated that they have roughly 500 developers working full time on their Call of Duty game series,<a class="source-sup" href="#source9">[4]</a> which has made them nearly 30 Billion dollars since 2003.<a class="source-sup" href="#source10">[5]</a> Also, there are many aspects of development for any given video game; everything from graphic design and art, to server/backend development and maintenance. However, for many games, the most time intensive and costly task is developing the game engine, or the core building blocks with which the rest of the game is made (more on game engines in a later blog post). So, for a small studio of only a handful of people, the prospect of creating a brand new game was quite daunting. However, from Dave’s roots of modifying or “modding” games on his dad’s computer -- and similar modding backgrounds amongst other studio members -- came another idea: instead of creating a new game from the ground up, create modifications or “mods” for a pre-existing game, and advertise those to game companies as dedicated game modes.
			<br><br>
			So, Dave and the team set off to complete this task. Their target: Unreal Tournament,<a class="source-sup" href="#source11">[6]</a> created by Epic Games. The Unreal Tournament (“UT”) series were arena-style first person player-vs-player games built on Epic’s UnrealScript/Unreal Engine. While common today, 3rd party game mods were not as prolific at the time, so UT made a name for itself by having its game be made from the ground up with the intention of promoting 3rd party mods. This model of allowing the users to support the studio’s game after launch turned out to be highly successful for Epic, as many people -- including Dave and Psyonix studios -- went on to make brilliant mods for UT. In an interview,<a class="source-sup" href="#source12">[7]</a> Dave recalls that Epic was very interested in having vehicles in their games, much like the Halo games did at the time. Given this knowledge and having an excited team of modders behind him, Dave set out to do just that -- create a mod to add vehicles to UT. After working hard the following year developing this mod (called… “Vehicle Mod”), they presented it to Epic and it was an instant hit. Epic was so impressed that they offered for Dave and his team to work directly out of the offices at Epic to create an official game mode for the next game in their UT series, Unreal Tournament 2004.<a class="source-sup" href="#source13">[8]</a> The Psyonix team worked diligently that year on producing this mode, “Onslaught”.<a class="source-sup" href="#source14">[9]</a> Along the way, they tried out many game mechanics and features; one of the more whimsical game mechanics they included was the ability to do “tricks” with the vehicles. Dave said, “that's one of the things I think I really enjoyed about UT, there weren't any rules -- you could do almost anything.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source12">[7]</a> Working closely with their level designer, Ben Beckwith, the team was able to integrate many platforms and jumps that encouraged this mechanic throughout their maps. When UT 2004 launched, Onslaught was its defining game-mode and was very successful. And although players ultimately did not fall in love with the “tricks” aspect of the game mode, the dev team loved it, and held onto the concept for later. 
			<br><br>
			UT 2004 was built primarily on what is now known as Unreal Engine 2.5.<a class="source-sup" href="#source15">[10]</a> So, due to working on UT 2004, Dave and the team became extremely familiar with the inner workings of UT’s game engine. Importantly, Psyonix was able to get the inside scoop on many of Epic’s projects, including the behind-the-scenes production of Epic’s Unreal Engine 3<a class="source-sup" href="#source16">[11]</a> -- the engine Rocket League would eventually be created on...
			
			But before discussing that, we will see how Dave and Psyonix were able to work with Epic to create various game titles with Unreal Engine 3, including Rocket League’s predecessor: <i>deep breath...</i><br><br> "Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars".<a class="source-sup" href="#source17">[12]</a>

		<h1>Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle-Cars</h1>
		<p>
			Last week, we discussed how in the early 2000s, Dave Hagewood’s small team of programmers, Psyonix Studios (“Psyonix”), earned the respect of Epic Games (“Epic”) when Psyonix created “Onslaught”, a vehicle-based game mode for Epic’s Unreal Tournament 2004 (“UT 2004”) using Epic’s proprietary game engine, Unreal Engine (v2.5).<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_1">[1]</a>
			<br><br>
			We left off with many questions, namely, where will Psyonix’s familiarity and proficiency with Unreal Engine lead them going forward, and how does it all eventually lead to the Rocket League game we know and love today? As has already been shown, the answers to these questions are fascinating… but not at all straightforward.
			<br><br>
			From working so closely with Epic on UT 2004, Dave had the leg up when he branched out with his Psyonix Studios team. In an interview,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_2">[2]</a> Dave stated, “I got that inside scoop on what Epic was doing and learned all about how the real game companies do it.” One of these “inside scoops” was that Epic’s Unreal Engine 3 (“UE3”)<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_3">[3]</a> would soon be released, and because of Psyonix’s familiarity with UE3, Epic would be looking to give them contract work. As will be discussed in a future blog post, Unreal Engine 3 would go on to be a massively popular game engine for hundreds of popular titles. <a class="source-sup" href="#source3_4">[4]</a> At the forefront of this revolution was Dave and his team, ready to jump on any opportunities they were presented with where they could use their Unreal Engine skills.
			<br><br>
			In anticipation of UE3’s launch, Dave tried to expand his team but ran into roadblocks. Ben Beckwith was already hired on to be the Lead Level Designer for Onslaught in UT 2004, but finding other talent who were willing to take an opportunity-cost risk to work for a startup like Psyonix was difficult; Dave stated, “I couldn’t hire anyone from the industry… they were like ‘Who is Psyonix?...I am going to go work for a really cool company.’” So, Dave created a “competitive internship” in October 2006. To entice people to work for him, he advertised that he knew all about Unreal Engine 3, and that “it is going to be big." He proclaimed, “I am big friends with Epic Games, and they’re giving me contract work.” Interestingly, although Epic created the engine and have many skilled developers who are knowledgeable about UE3, they didn’t outsource their game development expertise to other studios or publishers. Psyonix, however, saw this gap in the market and looked to essentially be a UE3 contracting company, where they would help other development teams work with the engine to create new games. 
			<br><br>
			So, Psyonix was in a really unique position, and that sentiment resonated with a few of the interns who would later become key figures in Rocket League’s development; Jared Cone would go on to be Rocket League’s Lead Gameplay Engineer, and Corey Davis would become Rocket League’s Design Director.
			<br><br>
			Approaching the release of UE3, Dave and the team had established two foundational rules for Psyonix’s future. Dave stated, “we’re always going to keep the company stable, we always need work coming in -- that’s kind of our base. But, we always need somebody working on original content. You go one way or another and it can be pretty dangerous.” Essentially, Dave was establishing that going “all-in” on the development of one game is extremely risky for a studio. Emmy Jonassen,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_5">[5]</a> the VP of Acquisition at Hubspot and a game marketing expert with over a decade of experience in the space said in 2013 that “95% of indie-games are not profitable. 80% of them operate at a loss.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_6">[6]</a> Back in 2007, This figure was likely even more dire for independent game studios, and Dave knew that truth. So, Dave’s thought was that taking a risk like that is likely to fail, and that instead they would need to rely on contract work as a steady income source. However, conversely, Dave and his team were also modders at heart, with creativity and creation in their blood; they  all wanted to develop something that was truly their own vision -- their “dream game”. So, instead of going all in on one game or going all in on contract work, the team decided they would amortize their game development risk over a long time while accumulating funds with contract work, and sooner or later, they would catch their big break. Dave reiterated that the fall of many studios was that they failed to maintain this balance; the studio would end up relocating their employees to either the contract or in-studio development teams when one or the other was more demanding. He insisted that if this happened, whichever side got less attention would end up dissolving. So, with these rules established, they began both their contract work, and their own game. Their contract work was clearly in front of them, but what would be their game?
			<br><br>
			That game would be a car acrobatics game based on the mechanisms developed in Onslaught in UT 2004. The initial idea for the game was roughly based on Dave and Ben Beckwith’s love of trick games such as the Tony Hawk skate games.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_7">[7]</a> Their game would include cars that could fly off of ramps and perform stunts, but as far as the actual goals of the game, much was up in the air.  “We didn’t know what it was, we just knew it involved cars that can jump and trick around,” said Dave. They tried many things, including timed obstacle courses, having cars that could shoot in a battle game (more reminiscent of Onslaught), Capture the Flag, Cops and Robbers, and many more. They eventually landed on developing a battle mode where, in American Gladiators or Smash-Bros style, players would try to push other cars off of a floating platform in the sky. This mode was initially called “Crash Course”, however later, “because the game was so crazy,” they changed it to be known as “Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle Cars” (“SARPBC”). The game was fun and was eventually offered a deal to be released on Xbox. SARPBC wasn’t without its issues, though. For example, the inherent difficulty of being able to hit other people off of the map while not falling off yourself actually detracted from the chaotic-fun energy the team envisioned. 
			<br><br>
			One day, Adam Beckwith, Ben’s brother, suggested adding a ball into the game. Adam and Ben had loved Deathball, a handball-like game with fun fast paced gameplay. “We loved the physics, sport, but individual-player aspect of the sport,” Ben said. Dave agreed to develop the mode, stating “we can try it... it would be a cool side mode." Well, this “side mode” was so much fun that despite having already negotiated a deal with Xbox to release SARPBC, they wanted to change course and develop this new game instead. “I don’t think for the next two weeks we got any work done because we were just playing this game,” Dave said. The difficulty was that Xbox was very strict about its platform, to the point where you couldn’t have a game on Xbox without a publisher, and as Dave said about SARPBC, “publishers were [already] looking at our game saying ‘I don’t get it at all’, and we weren’t making it any better by saying ‘okay now it is soccer with cars.’” Given this restrictiveness and difficulty marketing the concept of “car-soccer”, Psyonix decided to try to release the game on Playstation, which at the time was much more flexible with its creators and the requirements for publishing. So this was it, the genesis of the new SARPBC, a car-soccer game on Playstation.
			<br><br>
			In 2003, SARPBC was released on the PS3. As can be seen in the game’s original trailer,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_8">[8]</a> the game closely resembled the Rocket League we know today. However due to many factors, such as a poor name for marketing purposes and a variety of quirks and unpolished attributes, the game was not an overwhelming success. Corey Davis said in an interview<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_9">[9]</a> that “a lot of things that sabotaged [SARBPC] were techincal inefficiencies.” For example, Corey stated that the development team had always played the game on PCs, with “no input latency at 60 frames-per-second on a LAN connection” and that it was “[like a] different [game],” to play on PS3 over the internet. And while SARPBC would go on to eventually turn a profit two years after its release, it was a disappointment to the developers at Psyonix. Corey would go on to say “I think when you’re a veteran it hits you a little harder when something you make… isn’t a huge success. And at the time it was the second thing we had done, so it felt like ‘of course we will just move on to other projects.’”
			<br><br>
			Dave discussed how it is difficult during the final stages of a game’s development not to be all hands on deck -- the contracting aspect of the company was put on the backburner as they were nearing the release of SARPBC. He clearly bent his own rule about maintaining distance between the two different aspects of the company, and that this “pushed the company to the brink.” Dave had poured so much company time and resources into SARPBC, and since it wasn’t financially successful, they had to quickly revert back to doing more contract work. Dave recalls that “[Psyonix] had to take some projects quickly afterwards that were maybe not the most ideal terms and were really tough on us.” Further solidifying the difficulty Dave was alluding to previously about going all-in on one game’s development. If I were to guess, Dave’s rules about the duality of the studio weren’t even firm up to this point in his career as he likes to recount; I imagine instead that it was this moment after SARPBC’s failure that really drove home the risk involved to Dave with investing everything into one game’s development.
			<br><br>
			On top of the financial difficulty, an especially hard pill to swallow for the developers was that they personally loved playing SARPBC so much and they believed strongly that the game was capable of being successful if people really got into it. Dave said he thought at the time, “we need a bigger studio, we need more expertise at what we are doing… we are going to come back to [SARPBC],” and that “we always knew we were coming back to it at some point.” 
			<br><br>
			So, to strengthen their studio and stay afloat as a company, they took on more contract work. Psyonix went on to make a name for themselves by being very good at online multiplayer on UE3. For example, they worked on “Mass Effect 3”<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_10">[10]</a> as UE3 consultants, and then studios of other games, such as “Bulletstorm”,<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_11">[11]</a> contracted Psyonix to develop their entire multiplayer mode. Eventually the publishing company Square Enix<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_12">[12]</a> contracted Psyonix to develop their entire game “Nosgoth”.<a class="source-sup" href="#source3_13">[13]</a> Dave said “[Nosgoth] was a big deal for the studio. It allowed us to expand a lot, build our art team in particular and kind of become a really full-featured studio.” It was around this time that Psyonix decided to take another look at SARPBC.
			<br><br>
			Corey recalls, “you want to give contract work your all, especially just to keep the company going, but you always have these outlets for like ‘this is how we would do it if we were in charge.’” And now, being a full-featured studio capable of being in-charge, it was time to revisit SARPBC and create their dream game: Rocket League.

				<h1>Rocket League: AAA... Car-Soccer?</h1>
		<p>
			Last week, we discussed how Rocket League’s “car-soccer” predecessor, “Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars” (“SARPBC”) was created. Despite SARPBC capturing the intense interest of the development team at Psyonix Studios (“Psyonix”), SARPBC was not a massive hit with the general public. From poor optimization for consoles to unpolished gameplay mechanics to a -- quite frankly -- awful name for marketing purposes, the game clearly reflected Psyonix’s small team size and general lack of experience when SARPBC was released in 2008. However, in the years following its release, Psyonix would evolve into much more than the near-indie-game development team they were when they embarked on the creation of SARPBC. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			As discussed last week, after finishing SARPBC, Psyonix took on contract work for various AAA games where they could utilize their already-existing Unreal Engine 3 expertise. A couple of these games included “Mass Effect 3”<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_1">[1]</a> and “Nosgoth”<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_2">[2]</a> -- extremely popular and successful games. But that success not only meant the ability to hire more employees and continue to expand, the games were litmus tests indicating how far the team had come since the years prior when they worked on SARPBC. Dave Hagewood, Psyonix founder and CEO, spoke in an interview<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_3">[3]</a> about this: “all of the games that we were working on on the contract-work side are Unreal Engine 3, so they’re AAA, so we built a AAA team. We were used to not working on indie games anymore, we were making the best games in the business.” Essentially stating that through their money-making efforts of doing contract work, they nearly accidentally curated an expert team of AAA developers who were capable of creating some of the best games in the industry. Dave continues, saying he and the studio who loved SARPBC then had a thought: “let’s take our indie game, and let’s put the best-games-in-the-business side of things in it.” Here, Dave is stating that SARPBC, the studio’s first original title, was merely an indie game, and that with the experience they accrued, Psyonix could recreate it and make it really work this time. 
			
			<br><br>

			But if they were going to do it, they were going to do it. Dave recalls they were going to take all of the best features that they had worked obsessively on in other games and put them into SARPBC’s successor. Dave said, “we need the polish, we need the user interface, we need the matchmaking features that are up there with Halo and Call of Duty.” If they were going to revisit SARPBC -- which they know failed previously -- there would need to be no stone unturned. “There was this paranoia… if we didn’t … put everything we possibly could into this game, it might have the same reaction that it did the first time. And I think that’s why we just did the hell out of it.” Funnily, Dave also recalls that after developing Rocket League with all of these AAA-title features, “people were surprised. They were like ‘this is a weird game yet it has this polish that we haven’t seen on a game so zany.’” Corey Davis, SARPBC and Rocket League’s Design Director also said that “it was kind of embarrassing when you talk to other friends in the industry and they ask ‘what are you guys working on’ and I’m like ‘cars with soccer,’ and they would be like [sarcastically], ‘oh thats… cool….’”<a class="source-sup" href="#source4_3">[3]</a> Corey also said that “if you can expose it to people they seem to really like it but if you cant then it’s kind of a hard sell: ‘cars with soccer’ that sounds kind of stupid.”
			
			<br><br>

			And that was very true for multiple reasons. I can personally admit that when I had first heard of Rocket League, I thought the concept was a bit awkward and something I would have no interest in. I happened to stumble upon a YouTuber I liked at the time playing the game and I thought, “well if they are playing the game, I will at least take a look.” I ended up watching gameplay of it and found it intriguing. I eventually downloaded it to try it for myself, and, well, here I am five years later dedicating hours out of every week researching and writing solely about the game.
			
			<br><br>
			
			Interestingly, even two years after the game’s release, there was a steady player base on SARPBC. This reaffirmed to the team that SARPBC and Rocket League’s biggest challenge was exposing people to the game who would have discounted it otherwise for being too “zany” as I had done initially. So, the team determined that they would jump on any opportunity for free promotion of the game, including free-to-play weekends or similar events. And in fact, Psyonix did end up “[doing] the hell out of it” and created their “dream-game,” Rocket League, with all of the bells and whistles they imagined. But simply doing free promotion turned out to be a far more complex decision and massive deciding point for Psyonix and Rocket League as we will see next week when we discuss Rocket League’s release for free on Playstation Plus next week!

		<h1>Rocket League on Playstation® Plus</h1>
		<p>
			Last week we discussed the lead-up to the release of Psyonix Studios’s Rocket League in 2015. From starting out as a group of modders for Epic’s Unreal Tournament who then went on to do contract work for Epic directly, to branching out to create their first in-house game, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars(“SARPBC”), to finally perfecting their car-soccer dream with their game Rocket League, the team had clearly come a long way. But their work was not finished.
			
			
			<br><br>
			
			As we discussed previously, Rocket League was unique for many reasons. And many of the same things that helped turn it into one of the most popular games in the world today were once potential inhibitors or potential failure points. Namely, “car-soccer” was -- and still is -- such a truly bizarre idea. Since there were so few games remotely like it in the past, it was a difficult challenge to market and get people on board to try it in the first place. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			Nearing release time, the Psyonix team knew that the best chance they had for the game to be fiscally successful in the long run was to forfeit immediate revenue and to expose the game to as many people as possible through a free initial release. The hope here is that the lost revenue in the short term is worth it to potentially attract players who were already skeptical about the game who would be fully turned off from trying it by a price tag. Eventually, the hype and buzz generated from these players who initially tried it for free would sell more copies of the game once it was no longer free. So, given all of that, we can discuss how Rocket League was released for free on Playstation Plus, and what the strategy of Playstation Plus is in the first place.
			
			<br><br>
			
			In 2015, Playstation Plus was a subscription model where users would pay a fixed monthly rate to have access to various benefits, such as extra cloud storage, game discounts, and online multiplayer functionality. Maybe most enticing however, is Playstation’s monthly free-games lineup: every month, Playstation Plus members can download multiple games that were made free for members for that month only. Sony, the owner of Playstation, makes deals with various game companies to put their games into this monthly free-games lineup. This system is very interesting, and since 2015, subscription models for games and related software have increased in popularity and number (ex: Xbox Game Pass<a class="source-sup" href="#source5_1">[1]</a>, Apple Arcade<a class="source-sup" href="#source5_2">[2]</a>). However, it is an interesting balance for Sony and the game studio to reach a deal for a game to be released on Playstation Plus. Since Sony makes money off of users who subscribe to be able to have access to these games for free, Sony is compelled to try to find the best games possible to attract new subscribers, and they are also incentivised to advertise their game lineup -- advertisement that is beneficial for Sony and the game studio alike. However, since the game studio would be forfeiting a month’s revenue on the game (potentially their highest revenue month -- release month), game studios are far more reluctant to join into the free-games rotation unless they really need the advertisement or are compensated by Sony. A deal is ultimately made where Sony pays the game studio some amount of money that acts as a level of insurance for the studio which strikes this balance between risk for the studio not making their money back and risk for Sony of losing subscribers due to having inadequate games. Despite this compensation, it is not enough money to fully cover costs if the game fully dies out after its free month of release, so the risk is still very high for game studios.
			
			<br><br>

			Due to these risk factors, there was a great amount of debate amongst the employees of Psyonix about releasing Rocket League to Playstation Plus. Corey Davis, Design Director at Psyonix, said that early on, “it was a big worry, because we didn’t know if we made the right decision. We had a lot of fear that we would make no money on the game.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source5_3">[3]</a>
			Corey went on to describe the risk to the studio as such: “what if 5 million people download it and then no one buys it ever again and we’ve made nothing and we have to pay for servers for 5 million people.” Jeremy Durham, Vice President of Psyonix, recounts similar feelings, saying, “It took a lot of discussions. I still remember all of the meetings we had. All the way up to when the game was announced on Playstation Plus, we were on the fence.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source5_3">[3]</a>
		
			<br><br>
			
			Dave Hagewood, Psyonix Founder and CEO, also shared this sentiment when he discussed the success of the game’s beta before its release on Playstation Plus; there seemed to be a lot of hype for the game that wasn’t present for the release of SARPBC, so maybe Psyonix jumped the gun with the Playstation deal, and giving away the game for a month would be a terrible idea.
			
			<br><br>
			
			Next week we’ll dive into the chaos that was the initial release of Rocket League and discuss if it was ultimately the right business decision for Psyonix to release it onto Playstation Plus for free!

		<h1>Launching Rocket League</h1>
				
		<p>
			Last week we discussed the reasoning behind Psyonix’s plan to release Rocket League on Playstation Plus in 2015. Through a deal with Sony (creators of Playstation), Rocket League would be initially released to the public where paid subscribers of Playstation Plus would be able to download the game for free. And while Sony would pay Psyonix for some potential lost revenue during the time, it was still a massive risk for Psyonix. Psyonix had very little money nearing the release time of Rocket League to invest in marketing the game, however if a Playstation Plus deal was made, then Sony themselves would be incentivized to spend their far larger marketing budget on getting the word out about Rocket League, which is of course beneficial for Psyonix. However, consequently, anyone during this time who downloaded the game for free would never need to pay for the game later on. So on one hand, this deal could have potentially set Rocket League up well for years to come, and without the deal the game may have fallen flat early on because not enough players got hooked. However, on the other hand, Sony aggressively marketing their game for the only month where it is free could have lead to Psyonix losing a large amount of potential customers who may have otherwise purchased the game anyway -- if not during that month, at some point later on.
			<br><br>
			For Psyonix, the pros outweighed the cons, and the Playstation Plus deal went through… But how did it all turn out?
			<br><br>
			
			Dave Hagewood, Psyonix Founder and CEO spoke about the initial release of Rocket League in an interview, describing the first few days as if “everything was on fire."<a class="source-sup" href="#source6_1">[1]</a> And it was not because the game was failing, but rather it was too popular at launch due to the Playstation Plus deal. 
			<br><br>
			
			While the need to predict and manage initial popularity of a product at release may be more obvious for a company which sells physical products where supply chains and production time need to be balanced, what are the ways that a downloadable video game can run into issues due to popularity at launch?
			<br><br>
			
			Well, there are a number of reasons. For Rocket League, their issue stemmed from the unexpected volume of players from around the world concurrently playing in the days and weeks following the game’s release. Dave described that they expected a maximum of 50 thousand concurrent players on release day but that there were roughly 150 thousand concurrent players instead. To this, one’s immediate reaction may be “oh okay, so the servers got overloaded. Why don’t they just purchase more server space?” And while this is along the right track, it is a severe oversimplification of the issue of building scalable back-end architecture for games. 
			<br><br>
			
			For Rocket League and many other online games (or primarily offline games which still have some level of game server authority), the game was designed with a specific scale of players in mind. Additional server space does allow for more total information to be maintained online at one time, however the management of how those servers are utilized is up to the game developers. Decisions include how and what data is delivered from the client to the server, how large of a “motorway” there should be for data delivery to and from various clients in various countries, and other protocols for manipulating data between the client and server. There could be problems with certain clients/players and their internet service providers that not only causes an issue for them but for everyone on the server, and the more people play the higher chance there is to run into this issue. “Nobody is on an island when it comes to online games, and that can make responding to issues incredibly difficult and time consuming,” said Fredrik Brönjemark, director of live services at Massive Entertainment in an interview about game back-end development<a class="source-sup" href="#source6_2">[2]</a>. Fredrik also said that “running out of capacity is rarely the problem.”Additionally, Alex Mann, a development manager at EA described this issue of scalable back-end by saying “[it] isn’t about ‘Lets throw loads of money at it and make it bigger’... it’s often a bottleneck based on the technology and engine that you’re using.”<a class="source-sup" href="#source6_2">[2]</a>
			<br><br>
			
			Another issue could be a buggy codebase that only presents its issues when there are simply more people playing the game. The next section will talk about one specific type of bug, and it is a bit more technical -- I will be describing what a “memory leak” is and its possible negative implications. You definitely don’t need to know what it is, so skip <a href="#source6_skip">here</a> if you just want to know why it is relevant.
			<br><br>
			
			While running any program, your computer’s memory (RAM) is constantly being manipulated by the computer’s processor to store information needed to run the program. When something new needs to be stored to be used later, some amount of memory must be allocated to hold that information. For example, if you are playing Tetris, when you start a new game, your processor will allocate a small amount of space in memory to store your current score so that it can be continually updated and displayed as you play. In this scenario, when the game is concluded, your score will be displayed for its final frame, the game will go back to the menu-screen, and since the area of memory that is holding the score will no longer be manipulated, your processor will automatically allow that space to be used for something else and move on. 
			<br><br>
			
			But what if you want to keep track of your last score across multiple games? Here is where the analogy may not hold up to the rigorous scrutiny of fellow Computer Science students, but I will continue anyway since the key takeaway at the end is what is important. In this case of tracking multiple scores, you may choose to code your game so that the processor does not automatically start overriding the area of memory containing your score when you are out of the game (although writing this data to a file for later retrieval is most common). This is doable, and glossing over the technicalities of the implementation, now, unless you explicitly tell your processor that it can use that space for other things, it will leave that spot with your score alone until the entire program is terminated. So now you have a dedicated spot in memory for your previous score. 
			<br><br>
			
			The issue could arise when you go to play a second game. When the new game begins, the program could display your previous score and the game could get under way. Now, your game goes to create a new spot in memory for your current game score. Upon the conclusion of the game, the program may assign your current score to be under the same identifier of “previous score”, thereby evicting any way to access the first score you saved there. This is fine since you only want to know your previous score, however, what happens to that old memory? As far as the processor knows, you’ve told it to never use that space for anything else while the program is running, so you’d need to tell the processor that this memory can be re-used before it was reassigned… but if you forgot to do this by accident (a single mis-typed line of code), then that memory will have “leaked” out and will be unusable and unrecoverable for the duration of the program’s run. Now, every time the user goes to play a new game that session, a small bit of memory will become unusable, since as far as your processor is concerned, you still want to use it. Eventually, if you played enough times, the program would become slower and slower and eventually become unresponsive or crash. 
			<br><br>
			
			<a name="source6_skip"></a>
So, now we know that a “memory leak” is an error in code where slowly as the program is run a small amount of memory becomes unusable until the program is slowed to a halt and is entirely unresponsive. This type of error is preventable, but is definitely a plausible and real-world oversight in development. For many programs, a “memory leak” like this may not ever appear to be an issue to the user, since you’ll likely never sit down for one week-long uninterrupted session of Tetris. In fact, there is an amusing story of a developer creating software for missile navigation where instead of spending time and resources managing memory leaks and including only a small amount of memory on-board, they simply estimated the total amount of memory which would be leaked during the duration of the missile’s flight and included that amount of memory onboard, knowing it would be exploding anyway. While this is… valid... in that scenario, for server-side programs ran with little to no down-time, if there were even a small memory leak it could add up over time and cause an extremely unpleasant gaming experience -- especially if the memory leakage is directly tied to the amount of players online.
			<br><br>
			
			So as you can see, in at least one major way, simply “buying more server space” isn’t an end-solution. Dave described how in the early days of Rocket League’s release the servers were becoming so sluggish so quickly that, “I kid you not, at one point my wife, while I’m sleeping, is literally having to press a button every 15 minutes that resets something [with the servers].” I hypothesize that this was due to various issues, including potentially memory leaks on the back-end that were not caught when they were testing in-house or with far less players during the beta. This hypothesis is supported by Fredrik as he was discussing pitfalls of game releases in an interview: “Any number of things can go wrong on launch day, … there could be a memory leak, a single catastrophic line of incorrect code, or a spot of lag buried somewhere in the enormous server pipeline.”
			<br><br>
			
			If nothing else, I hoped to have shown you how the issue of back-end development and maintenance is complicated, and that the release of an online multiplayer game has many potential problems which can arise that can’t just be solved with a magic “buy more servers” wand.
			<br><br>
			
			Rocket League did go on to power through the first few weeks of struggling servers, eventually being able to fully redesign the backend to be capable of keeping up with the demand. As far as Playstation Plus, Dave said in 2016 that “we make more now every month than we did at launch,” and that “ I think you can almost objectively say that it was a good idea at this point.” But how did they turn such a profit in 2016, and how did their revenue stream strategy change throughout the years since its release? We will discuss that next week!

		<h1>What is a Game Engine?</h1>
		<p>
			As was mentioned in a previous post, the creator of Rocket League, Psyonix Studios, got its roots creating game mods for Epic Games’ "Unreal Tournament" game in the early 2000s. The Psyonix team and its founder, Dave Hagewood, eventually produced such impressive work that Epic contracted Psyonix to work directly out of their offices to create one of Epic's main game modes for Unreal Tournament 2004, a game created with Epic's Unreal Engine. Ultimately, the game mode was so successful that it resulted in Psyonix going forward as Unreal Engine experts capable of creating (or co-creating) AAA game titles. 
			
			<br><br>
			I alluded to it earlier, but why did Psyonix choose to use Unreal Engine? And importantly, what is Unreal Engine in the first place? To really discuss this, we really need to discuss a couple bigger topics over the next couple of blog posts. To start, what is a game engine in the first place?
			<br><br>
			I will get into specifics, but to start, a game engine is a framework for creating a video game which increases the quantity and quality of features in the game, improves video and audio quality, and increases performance; in general, it does these things overall really by reducing development time of a game and its core features. Put another way, a game engine is essentially a collection of building blocks of a video game that comes partially pre-constructed, with all of the remaining pieces laid out in front of you nicely organized and ready to pop into place.
			<br><br>
			If you were to set out to create a game, there would be many, many, many things you would need to account for and create to have a fully working finished product. This laundry list would include: audio systems, file systems, collision and physics simulation systems, input handling, window management, graphics systems for rendering textures, lighting, and particles, pathfinding and AI systems, optimization for Xbox, PS, PC hardware, and the list goes on.
			<br><br>
			But okay, say you do all of the above and you’ve created all of those core building blocks for yourself to include in your first ever game. Now say you’ve finished (... years later), and you’re looking to create a new game. More than likely, you will sit down with your new idea ready to code away at creating a brand new system for your new game and you will realize you have already coded a majority of what you will need for your next game in your previous game. So you go ahead, copy and paste a lot of code, and spend time changing hard-coded information that was specifically tied to the last game. Then you’re onto the next task. Again, you realize the next foundational item is something you’ve mostly already done in your last game. So you repeat the process. For any given game, there are many similar foundational elements all games need (as mentioned above), and knowing you’d like to make multiple games in the future, you decide that instead of reusing old code and needing to change it every time, it’d be better if you generalized your code a bit more so it could be easily imported into almost any project. Instead of specifically coding any given system to work for one game, you decide to store all of the relevant code in a package, but with the name of the game and specific details left blank to be filled in later as-needed. Of course this is oversimplifying, but essentially, you just created a “library” for some feature of a game. Next time you go to create a game, odds are (if you’ve programmed it well enough) you will be able to simply include this package and with minimal struggle, have your new game up and running with that system quickly. Additionally, if someone else were to want to create a game, they would likely need a system like the one you just made, so you could sell or license the ability to use your nicely packaged library to them. Hypothetically, if it took you six months to create a file-system game library, and someone else were looking to create their own but it would take them two months to create it (faster than your six months since it isn’t generalized), you could charge them the time-cost for a month of your work and begin to make money back on your effort. Eventually, if you license your work to enough people, everyone would walk away happy; you made a profit allowing other people to use the code you (painstakingly) made, and since it’s faster (and cheaper in terms of time-opportunity-cost) for them to use your library than it is to create their own feature-set, they would also be happy. Now, say you create many libraries. You could continue to license them out, piece by piece. Additionally, if there are enough aspects of it to begin to create a game nearly entirely off of just libraries you’ve created, then you’ve essentially made what a game engine is: a collection of libraries used to create a game. This is basically what Unreal Engine is: it’s just a really, really advanced, modular, and user-friendly collection of libraries and other building blocks needed to create a game. And there are a number of reasons Unreal Engine is such a great option for developers of some of the top-rated games in the world.
			<br><br>
			For one thing, remember that someone who would potentially want to purchase a license to use your hypothetical game libraries would still need to be able to code themselves; since they would simply be doing a glorified copy-paste of your library into their code-base, they would still need the knowhow to combine it all in the right way and to modify things to fit their desires. This is one way that Unreal Engine is so advanced: to create a game in Unreal Engine, you don’t technically need to write a single line of code. This is because Unreal Engine uses a system where you can create all aspects of a modern, cutting edge game through fill-in-the-blank boxes and drag-and-drop components. It is remarkable not only because it is inevitably saving time by abstracting away yet another layer of game development past just creating libraries or actually coding the fundamental building blocks, but it is making game development easier and more streamlined. That is not to say it is easy. It is slightly misleading to say you don’t need to know any coding, since you do still need to know core fundamentals of programming to be successful, and Unreal Engine is not heralded as the most beginner-friendly game engine out there, but it is extremely efficient at doing what it does best: creating amazingly impressive games. One thing to note is that this drag-and-drop system is not unique to Unreal Engine specifically, as other game engines have similar systems -- even Apple’s SwiftUI for iOS development has a user interface for app creation that abstracts away some of the direct coding in the Swift programming language.
			<br><br>
			Another reason Unreal Engine is a useful tool for game developers is its extensive assets library and shop: Unreal Marketplace. Here, yet another layer of development difficulty is eliminated, as you can purchase thousands and thousands of extremely high detailed assets to use in any game. It is called a marketplace for a reason, as these assets are almost entirely created by artists and graphic designers who sell their designs and models online, where Epic makes a commission for every sale. The amazing part about this is its integration with Unreal Engine, and its ease of access. Being able to peruse through thousands of potential assets to include a model of exactly what you want -- say, a snowman for your next snowboarding game -- is far, far easier than learning graphic design, and is much more cost effective than commissioning one specific person to create a snowman 3D model. It is cheaper because the design cost is amortized across the many game developers who already bought, or will buy, the snowman model. A win-win-win for you, the designer, and Epic.
			<br><br>
			An interesting thing to note about Epic’s monetization of Unreal Engine is that it began much like your hypothetical first game engine did: it was created in-house to aid future projects. However, much like Amazon’s “Amazon Web Services”, it quickly became such a successful tool that it now at the core of the company’s revenue stream and identity going forward.
			<br><br>
			It’s at this point that I should mention Unity, Unreal Engine’s largest competition in the game engine space. Unity is a very beginner-friendly game engine, and is more often the go-to for starting indie developers and primarily mobile developers. Unity-based games makes up about 70% of all mobile games in the top 1000 titles in the market,<a class="source-sup" href="#source7_1">[1]</a> while Unreal Engine is top-dog for creating AAA-titles with marvelous graphics. There are other differences, like how Unity’s asset store is more well filled out than Unreal’s at the moment, how Unreal’s development is more cumbersome than necessary for small-scale development, how Unity’s rendering is far slower than Unreal’s, etc. There are many decisions that need to be made when deciding what game engine to develop with, and these are just a few of the considerations. They both have their pros and cons, and an in-depth look at the differences between them is for another post.
			<br><br>
			Anyway, this is the fundamental reasoning behind what a game engine is and why a developer would want to use it.
			There are a few more interesting aspects of Unreal Engine to talk about.
			<br><br>
			Last year, Epic announced that developers building games on Unreal Engine would not need to pay royalties for using their engine until a developer has grossed over $1 million from the game. This decision is interesting, and very smart in my opinion. If Epic’s ultimate goal is to make as much money as possible, it would obviously be beneficial for more people to develop games using it. However, with other easy-to-use alternatives such as Unity, attracting developers to use Unreal for low-to-mid scale games is difficult. So, not charging royalties on games until they’ve grossed over $1 million takes away a push factor that may cause a developer to think twice about using Unreal Engine. Additionally though, Epic is not sacrificing that much, and the downside of not continuing with this model is far worse in my opinion. If there are ten development studios making only $100,000 annually, Epic would be forfeiting $50,000 in royalty fees with this new rule. However, if even a single one of those games became widely successful and made $1,500,000, Epic would instantly make $75,000 back, netting an opportunity-cost profit of $25,000. Of course all else being equal, if they also charged the other 9 studios the 5% royalty fee, they’d be making $120,000, however, this is assuming that the royalty fee didn't turn them all off from developing with Unreal Engine. If half of the developers decided to use a different platform, Epic would be roughly cutting their chance of having a “hit” be developed on Unreal Engine by half. Similar to how although only 2% of users spend money on in-app purchase or microtransactions, these 2% of people account for increases total revenue of mobile games by 90%,<a class="source-sup" href="#source7_2">[2]</a> Epic is banking on cashing out on the “2%” of game-studios who hit it big to be worth them not charging royalties on all developers.
			<br><br>
			Another interesting aspect of Unreal Engine is the improvements made over the years, from the original Unreal Engine in the late 90s to Unreal Engine 4 today and Unreal Engine 5 which is in early access currently and is likely to be widely released in 2022. There are many impressive new features with Unreal Engine 5, including new tools and optimizations of preexisting systems. For example, there is improved geometry system for rendering levels, and vastly improved sound design and management tools. One of the most exciting new additions to me is the support for file sizes up to 12K; a user would likely be rendering at 4K, or 8K at the absolute highest currently based on their monitor or TV, so 12K seems pointless. However, it is a good feature for two reasons. For one, it is future-proofed. Currently 1080p and 2K gaming still dominate the market, but 4K gaming is slowly becoming more popular, and 8K gaming is still unreasonable for most people. However, in the following years, this may change, so it is good that Unreal Engine will be able to support higher quality textures. An even more interesting reason this is a good feature is that it allows for textures which can be zoomed in on; imagine if a user wanted to zoom in on a model or texture in the game -- with higher resolution textures, Unreal Engine 5 will allow the game to dynamically render a 4K subsection of a 12K texture when zoomed in to optimize for both performance and visual fidelity.
			<br><br>
			These and many other changes will be interesting to follow, and an even broader discussion about game engines and the competition in the quickly growing space would be fun. Next week we will discuss more about Epic games and the role they played in Rocket League’s development. As a brief preview: Epic purchased Psyonix studios in 2019! Anyway, thanks for reading!

		<h1>Rocket League on Unreal Engine 5</h1>

		<p>
		
		On December 5th of this year (2021), Epic Games’ “Fortnite” moved its record breaking game away from Unreal Engine 4 game engine to the latest and greatest Unreal Engine 5.<a class="source-sup" href="#source8_1">[1]</a> There are many motivations behind this decision, which mostly boil down to potential for improved graphic performance causing games to run more smoothly, increase in in-game features, and improved visual effects and details (for more info, read previous post on game engines).
		<br><br>
		But how does this relate to Rocket League? If you recall, in a previous post we discussed how Epic Games supported the development team that would later go on to create Rocket League, Psyonix Studios. In fact, we discussed how Psynoix began creating mods for Epic’s Unreal Tournament games in the early 2000’s, and when Epic released Unreal Engine 3, Psyonix used their expertise to do contract work for major AAA titles in that engine.
		<br><br>
		So, when it came time to create Rocket League, Psyonix chose to use Unreal Engine 3. Notably though, when Rocket League was created, Unreal Engine 3 had already been out for nearly a decade. And to date, six years later, Unreal Engine 3 has been out for over 15 years. Since its release, Unreal Engine 4 and 5 have been released to the public, and numerous AAA titles and best-selling games have utilized these newer engines.
		<br><br>
		Also notably, in May of 2019, Epic Games acquired Rocket League creator, Psyonix Studios. This acquisition felt like a long time coming considering Psyonix and Epic’s relationship since the beginning, and given the fact that Rocket League was already running on Epic’s proprietary game engine. So, the big question remains looming… if Rocket League is such a popular game and game engines have drastically improved since 2007 when Unreal Engine 3 came out, how and when will Epic’s acquisition of Psyonix facilitate Rocket League’s move to Unreal Engine 5? Additionally, is it a straightforward improvement? What are the pros and cons?
		<br><br>
		One of the largest “pros'' for moving to Unreal Engine 5 is the fact that it has vastly improved optimization, while still increasing options for improved graphics and details at the same time. One large consideration when developing games is understanding what platforms will be running the game, and how well the game performs on each platform. Some developers can fail to keep this in mind, and could end up producing a game which is too intensive to run on older hardware, causing lag and stuttering, or they could downgrade the visual quality so much that although the game still runs “well”, it is not fun to play (similar to Cyberpunk on release). This is a serious consideration for Psyonix and Rocket League since Psyonix supports last-gen consoles like the Xbox One and Playstation 4. Many people in the Rocket League community have created modded workshop maps on PC, and as such the rest of the community has been desiring these same workshop maps on console. Also, fans that play on console constantly complain about the lack of new maps, and point to workshop maps on PC to say “look at how easy it is; someone who does not do it as their full time job can make a map in a couple of days, but a whole studio can’t make one in several months?” And while there is a small kernel of truth to it, the fact is, as Psyonix has said, workshop maps designed for PC players do not need to be optimized to run on last-gen consoles, unlike any officially-released Rocket League map. This, in many ways, is the most difficult aspect of actually creating a map; most of the time, fans who play on console are exposed to these workshop maps via YouTube, where their favorite content creators most likely have top-of-the-line PCs that cost upwards of $5,000, and which are 25 times more expensive than a last gen console. So, of course, their PCs run the game and the (relatively) poorly-optimized custom-maps flawlessly, however the last-gen consoles would struggle to be playable at all.
		<br><br>
		Unreal Engine 5 could absolve much of this issue in a couple ways. Primarily, since it has better optimization than Unreal Engine 3, Unreal Engine 5 will have Rocket League running better than it did previously to begin with. Additionally, Unreal Engine 5 allows for more dynamic-quality textures and options, meaning for newer consoles you can improve visual fidelity while still being able to disable these options to keep the game essentially the same as it has always looked on older-gen consoles.
		<br><br>
		Online functionality has also been a point of contention on Unreal Engine 3 compared to Unreal Engine 5. For example, there are limited match sizes (maximum 4v4 for 8 total users in one lobby). Also, voice chat is extremely poor quality and is basically a non-feature in the game (I personally have never used it my years of playing the game). Unreal Engine 5 would greatly improve these systems, since it has emphasized improvement for open-world style games with many players, and has more modern voice-chat encoding and processing.
		<br><br>
		Also, unlike Fortnite, Rocket League does not have a “creative mode”, which has been a long requested feature from Rocket League fans. And it seems as though Psyonix hears the requests and wishes to implement them, however, it is another Unreal Engine 3 limitation. 
		<br><br>
		So, since many features of a lot of popular, modern online games such as Fortnite are really not possible on Unreal Engine 3, Rocket League has announced it will be moving to Unreal Engine 5 in the future.
		<br><br>
		There are, however, downsides to moving to Unreal Engine 5. Most notably the fact that the physics engines are fundamentally different between Unreal Engine 3 and 5, and thus a movement of game engines would alter the “feel” of the game. For some games, this would be a non-issue. However for an esport like Rocket League where decisions need to be made within split seconds to decide trajectories of ball bounces within inches, any change to the way the game behaves could be massively disruptive to its core player base and esports professionals who’s careers depend on their Rocket League ability. For this reason, the move to Unreal Engine 5 has garnered some pushback. Despite this, however, the community is overwhelmingly in favor of this transition.
		<br><br>
		Personally, I am extremely excited to see Rocket League transition to Unreal Engine 5 and not be left behind in the times. I believe moving engines will allow Rocket League to stay popular, relevant, and enjoyable to play for years to come. And as we’ve talked about in previous posts, the charm of Rocket League is its concept, not its exact implementation; so I strongly believe that even despite the changes to the game “feel” that may come to the surface, we as players will adapt quickly and will have our annoyance more than paid for by all of the amazing features Unreal Engine 5 would allow. 
		<br><br>
		Psyonix has confirmed the move to Unreal Engine 5, but has since not given a timeline or date of release, and have stated that they are treating the move like a “long-term project”<a class="source-sup" href="#source8_2">[2]</a> that will potentially still take years. 
		<br><br>
		Here’s to the future and to this Rocket League blog!
